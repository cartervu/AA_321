\section{Background and objectives}\label{objs}
The state of stress at various points on a thin, performatd aluminum sheet is determined by means of electrical resistance strain gauges. The test specimen has a 1-in diameter hole at its center. The loads have been applied with the department's Dillon manual testing machine.

\end{figure}

Strain gauges have been installed on the specimen at locations 1, 2, and 3. In addition, a strain gauge rosette, consisting of three strain gauges mounted on a common center at 45$^\circ$ to each other, has been installed at locations 4-6 (same spot). The dimensions of the specimen and locations of the strain gauges are provided on a separate sheet.\\

Testing procedure:
\begin{itemize}
\item Six tensile loads were applied to the specimen: $300$, $400$, $500$, $700$, $800$, and $1000$ lbs.
\item In each run, the test specimen was ``detorqued'' (see video) after reaching the test load, so look for the section of the testing data where the strain on gauge 5 is $\sim 0$ (or at least, much less than that on gauges 4 and 6). Take this to be the measurement.
\item As usual, positive strain indicates tension while negative values represent compression.
\end{itemize}

\section{Data reduction and report}
Be sure to watch the video before your analysis! Please address the following questions:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item Calculate the stress value $\sigma_y$ which would exist without a hole.
\item Calculate the stresses $\sigma_y$ at points 1 and 2 and $\sigma_x$ at point 3 from the measured strains (assume uniaxial stress at these points).
\item Compare the measured stresses at 1, 2, and 3 with the result of question 1 as well as with the theoretical values predicted for a plate with a hole in it.
\item From the strain rosette measurements (4-6) determine the magnitudes and directions of the principal stresses $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ at the center of the rosette. Note the directions of the applied strain gauges.
\item Determine the magnitudes of the stress components $\sigma_r$, $\sigma_\theta$, and $\tau_{r\theta}$ in the radial and tangential directions at the center of the rosette. Compare the results to the theoretical values and explain any discrepancies. 
\item How might the accuracy of local stress measurements with strain gauges be improved?
\item If the yield strength of the specimen be $50000$ psi, what is the maximum load that can be applied before the specimen yields?
\item How might the stress concentration problem be alleviated?
\end{enumerate}
Assume that $E = 10^7$ psi and $\nu = 0.34$ (Poisson ratio) for your calculations.
